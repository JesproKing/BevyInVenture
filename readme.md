Special Thanks to Jan Hohenheim for the amazing Foxtrot-Template

### Updating assets

You should keep the `credits` directory up to date. The release workflow automatically includes the directory in every

### Updating the icons

1. Replace `build/windows/icon.ico` (used for windows executable and as favicon for the web-builds)
2. Replace `build/macos/icon_1024x1024.png` with a `1024` times `1024` pixel png icon and run `create_icns.sh` (make
   sure to run the script inside the `macos` directory) - _Warning: sadly this seems to require a mac..._
